TODO for later:
- http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windowsserver2003/technologies/security/ws03qswp.mspx
- Add "Close keystore" functionality (see also PKCS #11 stuff)
- Icon for "Examine SSL/TLS connection" menu item
- PKCS #11
  - icon for menu item, doc update
  - check "save", "save as" and "change keystore type"
  - logout, login from java.security.AuthProvider (from J2SE 5)
- Change "Copy" and "Copy as XML" in keystore report to "Save as (XML)".
  I have a hunch that clipboards may screw up the encoding which is fatal at
  least with XML...
- Suggest a sane filename when saving a newly created keystore for the
  first time.
- Add option to do (IOW, not bypass) hostname and certificate checks when
  examining SSL/TLS connections.
- Improve exception show dialog to display multiple exceptions
- java 1.6 better iconimage etc PNG (transparent?) support
  but but... http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t91501.html
- Configurable URLConnection timeouts
- Check JCE keystores created with IBM's Java ("JCEKS", "IBMJCE")
- Direct import from cert view dialog if a keystore is open (CA certs only?)
- Enable multiselection in keystore table with appropriate popup menu
  (delete only?)
- Allow editing fields of self signed certs in keystores?
- XML, Jar, etc signing
- Save (as .properties) button to system properties view?
- User-Agent for internal HTTP requests?
- URLConnection caching API?
- Show used handshake stuff in SSL examine dialog
- Support typing URLs to file choosers
- OCSP client
