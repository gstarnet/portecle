    <h1>How to set a keystore key pair entry's password</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Note that <b>PKCS #12</b> keystore's do not require passwords for their
      key pair entries.  This functionality is therefore not available for
      <b>PKCS #12</b> keystores.  To set a keystore key pair entry's password:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Right-click on the key pair keystore entry in the
        keystore entries table.  Select the <b>Set Password</b> item from
        the resultant pop-up menu.</li>

      <li>The <b>Set Key Pair Entry Password</b> dialog will appear.
        Fill out the dialog's fields with the old password, and new
        password and new password confirmation.  If you have already
        supplied a password for the key pair entry then the old password
        field will have already been filled out for you.  Press the
        <b>OK</b> button to confirm the dialog.</li>
    </ol>
