    <p>
      <b>Portecle</b> has a simple interface which provides access to a
      keystore either by loading it from a file or by creating it from
      scratch:

    </p>

    <p>
      Keystore files can be created, opened and saved via the <b>File</b> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      The contents of Certificate and CRL files can be examined
      through use of the options on the <b>Examine</b> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      General keystore maintenance operations are accessible through
      the <b>Tools</b> menu.  These general operations include the
      capability to examine the content of certificate files, to
      import trusted certificates, to generate key pairs and change
      keystore type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of the operations found in the <b>File</b>, <b>Examine</b>
      and <b>Tools</b> menus are also available on the tool bar.  Most
      operations also have shortcut keys.
    </p>

    <p>
      The entries contained within a loaded keystore are displayed in
      the keystore entry table which has columns for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>An entry's type (<b>Key</b>&nbsp;<img src="key_entry.gif"
          alt="Key entry icon" width="18" height="18">,
        <b>Key Pair</b>&nbsp;<img src="keypair_entry.gif"
          alt="Key pair entry icon" width="18" height="18"> or
        <b>Trusted Certificate</b>&nbsp;<img src="trustcert_entry.gif"
          alt="Trusted certificate entry icon" width="18" height="18">).</li>
      <li>Alias name.</li>
      <li>Last modification date/time (Note: PKCS #12 keystores do not
        support this column).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Operations specific to a keystore entry can be accessed by
      right-clicking on the particular entry in the table and
      selecting the required operation from the resultant pop-up menu.
      The options available in the pop-up menu differ depending on the
      keystore entry type.  For example <b>Trusted Certificate</b>
      entries can be examined, deleted or renamed.  <b>Key Pair</b>
      entries can additionally have their passwords set, be used to
      generate CSRs, etc.  <b>Key</b> entries can only be deleted at
      the time of writing.
