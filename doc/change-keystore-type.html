    <hr>

    <p>
      To change a keystore's type:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>From the <b>Tools</b> menu, choose the <b>Change Keystore
        Type</b> sub-menu.</li>

      <li>From this menu you can choose between supported keystore types (see
        <a href="create-keystore.html">How to create a new keystore</a> for
        information about keystore types).</li>

      <li>Choose the menu item corresponding to the required type.
        Note that the current type will be disabled.</li>

      <li>The keystore type will now be changed.
        <ul>
          <li>If the current keystore type is not <b>PKCS #12</b>, any of the
            keystore's entries are of type <b>Key Pair</b> and you have yet to
            supply the password for the entry then the <b>Key Pair Entry
            Password</b> dialog will be displayed for each of the key pair
            entries.  Enter the key pair entry's password and acknowledge the
            dialog by pressing <b>OK</b>.</li>
          <li>If the current keystore type is <b>PKCS #12</b> then any key pair
            entries will have their password set to 'password'.
          <li>Keystore entries of type <b>Key</b> will be lost in the
            change if the action is confirmed.</li>
          <li>When converting from a keystore type that supports case sensitive
            entry aliases to one that does not, an option to abort the action
            is offered if a potential problem is detected.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    </ol>
